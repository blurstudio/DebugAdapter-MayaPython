                    DebugAdapter-MayaPython
---------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for installing the debug adapter for running Python in 
Maya. Please ensure you have the "Debugger" plugin installed. 
If not, please install it and restart Sublime before continuing.


To begin using, open a command port in Maya using the command:
	
	cmds.commandPort(name="localhost:7001", sourceType="mel")

The hostname and port can be changed within your project 
settings under 

	settings -> debug.configurations -> maya 

in the configuration named Maya Python Debugging.

The host/port in the Maya Python Debugging configuration is to 
interface with ptvsd, which is imported in Maya for debugging.
